# fend-Udacity-LandingPage

## Description:

The project is part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Content.

It consists of only three main files, as shown in the structure below:

```
css
- styles.css    
index.html
js
- app.js
README.md
```
The promise of this project is to make a multi-section landing page with a navigation menu that is build dynamicaly.

It will serve as a canvas to practice heavy DOM manipulation relying only on pure JavaScript, CSS and HTML. **NO EXTERNAL LBRARIES**

## Functionalities:

* Navigation menu is built dynamically as an unordered list from a list of the sections added to the page.
* Sections that are being viewd on the screen are labeled with an active state thus making it clear to the user wich section they're currently viewd while scrollin through the page.
* Clicking an item from the navigation menu will scroll to the approriate section.
* Navigation items have an active state reflecting their correponding sections while they're in the viewport.
* Sections are collapsable.
* Responsive navigation menu for smaller screens.
* While not scrolling through the page, the navigation menu hides after a certain amount of innactivity.
* A scroll to top button that is displayed when the user scrolls past the top of the page.
* Scrolling animation.
